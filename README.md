*Thessaloniki Ruby Meetup home*

About
------
Here are some moodboards and mockups for the homepage of Thessrb.io.

Looking for similar OS communities and after some research I 've managed to create a basic architecture for this website.
These are just proposals, the Ruby Community will decide about the design, elements, content ect of the final website.

I must confess that the **logo** provided made things a bit difficult. The way it is designed (lines and no fill) does not allow for too much flexibility on the design. This is my poor opinion. Anyway this is the logo and we have to deal with it.
